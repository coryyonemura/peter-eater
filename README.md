## Inspiration

Every day is plagued with constant argument with our hallmates over which dining hall we are going to eat at for the night. To put an end to this turmoil, we wanted to create an app that objectively shows which dining hall students think is best. 

## What it does

Peter Eater is a service that enables UCI students to rate their meals at the two dining halls on campus, Anteatery and Brandywine. It also allows them to view the ratings and comments of other students who have eaten the same meals. The service aggregates the ratings for each meal at each dining hall and calculates the daily average to determine which dining hall performed better for that day. At the end of every quarter, we curate a “Spotify Wrapped” style recap for each dining hall.

## How we built it

We used TypeScript and React Native for the frontend, Python, JavaScript, and SQLite on the backend and then we used CSS for the overall design of our app.

## Challenges we ran into

The major challenges we ran into was working with React Native since none of us had any prior experience, connecting the frontend to the backend via Flask, and converting our Figma to CSS.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Connecting the frontend to the backend! Working and navigating between different screens in React Native. Learning a completely new language in less than a day!

## What we learned

How to collaborate effectively! Got more acquainted with Git, and exposed to several new languages.

## What's next for Peter Eater

We are planning on implementing several features soon.

* Calendar Archive: See past ratings and comments of any meal and compare the dining halls over time.

* Image Upload: Upload pictures of your food with your ratings and comments.

* Reactions and Voting: React to other students’ feedback with emojis and votes.
